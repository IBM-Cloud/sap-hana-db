# Automation solution for SAP HANA 2.0 DB deployment using Terraform and Ansible integration.

## Description
This automation solution is designed for the deployment of **SAP HANA 2.0 DB** using CLI. SAP HANA solution will be deployed on top of one of the following Operating Systems: **SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP 3 for SAP**, **SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP 4 for SAP**, **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 for SAP**, **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 for SAP** in an existing IBM Cloud Gen2 VPC, using an existing bastion host with secure remote SSH access.

The solution is based on Terraform scripts and Ansible playbooks executed in CLI and it is implementing a 'reasonable' set of best practices for SAP VSI host configuration.

**It contains:**
- Terraform scripts for the deployment of two VSIs, in an EXISTING VPC, with Subnet and Security Group. The VSIs are intended to be used: one for the data base instance and the other for the application instance.
- Ansible scripts to configure SAP HANA 2.0 node.
Please note that Ansible is started by Terraform and should be available on the same host.

## Installation media
SAP HANA installation media used for this deployment is the default one for **SAP HANA, platform edition 2.0 SPS05** available at SAP Support Portal under *INSTALLATION AND UPGRADE* area and it has to be provided manually in the input parameter file.

## VSI Configuration
The VSIs are deployed with one of the following Operating Systems for DB server: Suse Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP 3 for SAP HANA (amd64), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 for SAP HANA (amd64) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 for SAP HANA (amd64). The SSH keys are configured to allow root user access. The following storage volumes are creating during the provisioning:

HANA DB VSI Disks:
- the disk sizes depend on the selected profile, according to [Intel Virtual Server certified profiles on VPC infrastructure for SAP HANA](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-hana-iaas-offerings-profiles-intel-vs-vpc) - Last updated 2022-01-28

Note: LVM will be used for **`/hana/data`**, **`hana/log`**, **`/hana/shared`** and **`/usr/sap`**, for all storage profiles, excepting **`vx2d-44x616`** and **`vx2d-88x1232`** profiles, where **`/hana/data`** and **`/hana/shared`** won't be manged by LVM, according to [Intel Virtual Server certified profiles on VPC infrastructure for SAP HANA](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-hana-iaas-offerings-profiles-intel-vs-vpc#vx2d-16x224) - Last updated 2022-01-28 and to [Storage design considerations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-storage-design-considerations#hana-iaas-mx2-16x128-32x256-configure) - Last updated 2022-05-19

For example, in case of deploying a HANA VM, using the default value for VSI profile `mx2-16x128`, the automation will execute the following storage setup:  
- 3 volumes x 500 GB each for `<sid>_hana_vg` volume group
  - the volume group will contain the following logical volumes (created with three stripes):
    - `<sid>_hana_data_lv` - size 988 GB
    - `<sid>_hana_log_lv` - size 256 GB
    - `<sid>_hana_shared` - size 256 GB
- 1 volume x 50 GB for `/usr/sap` (volume group: `<sid>_usr_sap_vg`, logical volume: `<sid>_usr_sap_lv`)
- 1 volume x 10 GB for a 2 GB SWAP logical volume (volume group: `<sid>_swap_vg`, logical volume: `<sid>_swap_lv`)

## IBM Cloud API Key
For the script configuration add your IBM Cloud API Key in terraform planning phase command 'terraform plan --out plan1'.
You can create an API Key [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).

## VPC Configuration
The Security Rules inherited from BASTION deployment are the following:
- Allow all traffic in the Security group for private networks.
- Allow outbound traffic  (ALL for port 53, TCP for ports 80, 443, 8443)
- Allow inbound SSH traffic (TCP for port 22) from IBM Schematics Servers.

## Files description and structure:
 - `modules` - directory containing the terraform modules
 - `input.auto.tfvars` - contains the variables that will need to be edited by the user to customize the solution
 - `integration.tf` - contains the integration code that brings the SAP variabiles from Terraform to Ansible.
 - `main.tf` - contains the configuration of the VSI for SAP single tier deployment.
 - `provider.tf` - contains the IBM Cloud Provider data in order to run `terraform init` command.
 - `variables.tf` - contains variables for the VPC and VSI
 - `versions.tf` - contains the minimum required versions for terraform and IBM Cloud provider.
 - `output.tf` - contains the code for the information to be displayed after the VSI is created (Hostname, Private IP, Public IP)

## Steps to follow:

For initializing terraform:

```shell
terraform init
```

For planning phase:

```shell
terraform plan --out plan1
# you will be asked for the following sensitive variables: 'ibmcloud_api_key'  and  'hana_main_password'.
```

For apply phase:

```shell
terraform apply
```

For destroy:

```shell
terraform destroy
# you will be asked for the following sensitive variables as a destroy confirmation phase:
'ibmcloud_api_key'  and  'hana_main_password'.
```

The Terraform version used for deployment should be >= 1.3.6. 
Note: The deployment was tested with Terraform 1.3.6
