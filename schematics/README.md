# Automation solution for SAP HANA 2.0 DB deployment using IBM Schematics

## Description
This automation solution is designed for the deployment of **SAP HANA 2.0 DB** using IBM Cloud Schematics. SAP HANA solution will be deployed on top of one of the following Operating Systems: **SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP 3 for SAP**, **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 for SAP**, **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 for SAP** in an existing IBM Cloud Gen2 VPC, using an existing bastion host with secure remote SSH access.

The solution is based on Terraform remote-exec and Ansible playbooks executed by Schematics and it is implementing a 'reasonable' set of best practices for SAP VSI host configuration.

**It contains:**
- Terraform scripts for the deployment of one VSI, in an EXISTING VPC, with Subnet and Security Group. The VSI is intended to be used for the data base instance.
- Bash scripts used for the checking of the prerequisites required by SAP VSI deployment and for the integration into a single step in IBM Schematics GUI of the VSI provisioning and the **SAP HANA 2.0 DB** installation.
- Ansible scripts to configure a HANA 2.0 single node.

## Installation media
SAP HANA installation media used for this deployment is the default one for **SAP HANA, platform edition 2.0 SPS05** available at SAP Support Portal under *INSTALLATION AND UPGRADE* area and it has to be provided as input data.

## VSI Configuration
The VSI is deployed with with one of the following Operating Systems for DB server: Suse Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP 3 for SAP HANA (amd64), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 for SAP HANA (amd64) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 for SAP HANA (amd64). The SSH keys are configured to allow root user access. The following storage volumes are creating during the provisioning:

HANA DB VSI Disks:
- 3 x 500 GB disks with 10000 IOPS - DATA.

## IBM Cloud API Key
The IBM Cloud API Key should be provided as input value of type sensitive for "ibmcloud_api_key" variable, in `IBM Schematics -> Workspaces -> <Workspace name> -> Settings` menu.
The IBM Cloud API Key can be created [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).

## Input parameters
The following parameters can be set in the Schematics workspace: VPC, Subnet, Security group, Resource group, Hostname, Profile, Image, SSH Keys and the SAP system configuration variables, as below:

**Obs***: <br />
- Sensitive - The variable value is not displayed in your Schematics logs and it is hidden in the input field.<br />
- The following parameters should have the same values as the ones set for the BASTION server: REGION, ZONE, VPC, SUBNET, SECURITYGROUP.
- For any manual change in the terraform code, you have to make sure that you use a certified image based on the SAP NOTE: 2927211.

## VPC Configuration

The Security Rules inherited from BASTION deployment are the following:
- Allow all traffic in the Security group for private networks.
- Allow outbound traffic  (ALL for port 53, TCP for ports 80, 443, 8443)
- Allow inbound SSH traffic (TCP for port 22) from IBM Schematics Servers.

 ## Files description and structure:

 - `modules` - directory containing the terraform modules
 - `main.tf` - contains the configuration of the VSI for the deployment of the current SAP solution.
 - `output.tf` - contains the code for the information to be displayed after the VSI is created (Hostname, Private IP)
 - `integration.tf` - contains the integration code that makes the SAP variabiles from Terraform available to Ansible.
 - `provider.tf` - contains the IBM Cloud Provider data in order to run `terraform init` command.
 - `variables.tf` - contains variables for the VPC and VSI
 - `versions.tf` - contains the minimum required versions for terraform and IBM Cloud provider.

## Steps to follow:

1.  Make sure that you have the [required IBM Cloud IAM
    permissions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources) to
    create and work with VPC infrastructure and you are [assigned the
    correct
    permissions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-access) to
    create the workspace in Schematics and deploy resources.
2.  [Generate an SSH
    key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-ssh-keys).
    The SSH key is required to access the provisioned VPC virtual server
    instances via the bastion host. After you have created your SSH key,
    make sure to [upload this SSH key to your IBM Cloud
    account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc-on-classic-vsi?topic=vpc-on-classic-vsi-managing-ssh-keys#managing-ssh-keys-with-ibm-cloud-console) in
    the VPC region and resource group where you want to deploy the SAP solution
3.  Create the Schematics workspace:
    1.  From the IBM Cloud menu
    select [Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/schematics/overview).
       - Click Create a workspace.   
       - Enter a name for your workspace.   
       - Click Create to create your workspace.
    2.  On the workspace **Settings** page, enter the URL of this solution in the Schematics examples Github repository.
     - Select the latest Terraform version.
     - Click **Save template information**.
     - In the **Input variables** section, review the default input variables and provide alternatives if desired.
    - Click **Save changes**.

4.  From the workspace **Settings** page, click **Generate plan** 
5.  Click **View log** to review the log files of your Terraform
    execution plan.
6.  Apply your Terraform template by clicking **Apply plan**.
7.  Review the log file to ensure that no errors occurred during the
    provisioning, modification, or deletion process.

The output of the Schematics Apply Plan will list the public/private IP addresses
of the VSI host, the hostname and the VPC.
